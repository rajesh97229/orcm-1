/****    QUEUE TYPE    ****/
/* ORCM maintains a collection of queues for holding
 * pending session requests. The configuration of
 * queues (e.g., how many and their relative priority)
 * is provided at startup from the orcm-site.xml
 * configuration file. Addition and deletion of queues
 * can be done dynamically via a console command.
 * Individual nodes can only be assigned to one queue
 * at a time, but can be moved across queues on-the-fly.
 * Changing queues will not impact executing applications
 *
 * Each queue maintains a priority-ordered array of
 * pending session requests, organized in "bins"
 * according to the range of various resources. For
 * example, a queue may contain a "power_binned" where
 * each element in the array contains session requests
 * that require power within a certain range. Thus,
 * there might be an array of session requests whose
 * power requirement falls between 100-200kw, and another
 * array of requests whose power requirement falls
 * in the 200-300kw range. This allows the scheduler
 * to rapidly select a session to be started without
 * having to consider all options in a linear manner.
 *
 * Note that a single session request could appear
 * in multiple binned arrays - e.g., once for power
 * and again for nodes.
