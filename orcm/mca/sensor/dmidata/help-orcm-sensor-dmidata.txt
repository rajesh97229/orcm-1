[req-dir-not-found]
Core temperature monitoring was requested, but this node
lacks the required directory:

  Node:  %s
  Directory:  %s

This usually indicates that the "coretemp" kernel module
has not been loaded. Operation will continue, but core
temperatures will not be monitored.

[no-cores-found]

you lack authority to access them:

  Node:  %s

This usually indicates that the "coretemp" kernel module
has not been loaded. Operation will continue, but core
temperatures will not be monitored.
