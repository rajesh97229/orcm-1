# Note that -l@ORTE_LIB@ -l@OPAL_LIB@ and all the EXTRA_LIBS are only necessary when
# static linking (they're pulled in by lib@ORTE_LIB@.so's implicit
# dependencies), so only list these in Libs.private.

# It is safe to hard-wire the -I before the EXTRA_INCLUDES because we
# will not be installing this .pc file unless --enable-devel-headers is
# selected, meaning that there will definitely be a value in EXTRA_INCLUDES.
